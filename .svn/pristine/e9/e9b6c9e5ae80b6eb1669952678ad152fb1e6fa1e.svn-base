Description:
Maven project developed in Eclipse IDE in Java using Selenium Webdriver and TestNG tools.
All test scenarios were executed in Firefox browser.
In order to create and organize the Selenium project, 2 automation framework creation 
techniques were used: Page Object Model and Page Object Factory.
Project was splited in 3 levels of test classes in order to reuse existing functionality. 
Complete_Test.java file located in src/test/java/com/gametwist/ contains 
the actual test steps and provides high level description of test cases.
Those test steps call functions of classes at the second level located 
at src/main/java/com/gametwist/appModules/ , whcih in his turn calls 
functions of classes at the third level, the page object level.
The third level, which located at src/main/java/com/gametwist/pageObjects/ , 
provides page specific classes one for each page at www.gametwist.com
